Sourcegraph Data Center cluster.

## Contributing

We've made this Helm chart open source to better serve our customers' needs. If there is a
configuration point or Kubernetes option you would like to add, we would love to incorporate
it. Pull requests and issues are reviewed and responded to quickly.
