# Sourcegraph Data Center

The Data Center deployment option for Sourcegraph is for organizations that need highly scalable, highly available code
search and intelligence for 10,000s of repositories and users. See [pricing](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing/),
and [contact us](https://about.sourcegraph.com/contact/sales) for more information.


## Install

Sourcegraph Data Center is deployed using Kubernetes. Before proceeding with these
instructions, [provision a Kubernetes](README.k8s.md) cluster on the infrastructure of your choice.

1. Fork this repository and clone the fork to your local machine.

1. Copy the contents of `conf.default.yaml` to a file named `conf.yaml`.

1. Set the appropriate value for `cluster.storageClass.create` in `conf.yaml`. If this field is set to something other
   than `none`, a value must be specified for `cluster.storageClass.zone`, too. This
   configures [Dynamic Volume Provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/) in the
   Kubernetes cluster.

1. Edit the other fields in `conf.yaml` to set the configuration values of your choice. At the top level,
   `conf.yaml` has two fields:
   * `cluster` configures the the Kubernetes cluster. Consult
     the [scaling documentation](https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs/datacenter/scaling) for advice
     on tuning the CPU, memory, and replication settings.
   * `site` is [Sourcegraph site configuration](https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs/config/settings)

1. Install Tiller (the server-side counterpart to Helm) on your cluster:

   ```bash
   # Give Helm privileges to create RBAC resources.
   kubectl create serviceaccount --namespace kube-system tiller
   kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller

   # Add Helm to your cluster using the created service account.
   helm init --service-account tiller
   ```

   If installing Tiller is not an option, consult the instructions below for installing without Tiller. If your
   Kubernetes environment does not permite RBAC, consult the instructions below for installing without RBAC.

1. Install the Helm chart to your cluster. From the root of this directory, run the following:

   ```bash
   helm install -f constants.yaml -f conf.yaml --name sourcegraph .
   ```

   If you see the error `could not find a ready tiller pod`, wait a minute and try again.

1. Confirm that your deployment is launching by running `kubectl get pods`. If pods get stuck in `Pending` status, run
   `kubectl get pv` to check if the necessary volumes have been provisioned (you should see at least 4). Google Cloud
   Platform users may need to [request an increase in storage quota](https://cloud.google.com/compute/quotas).

1. When the deployment completes, you need to make the main web server accessible over the network to external users. To
   do so, connect port 30080 (or the value of `httpNodePort` in the site config) on the nodes in the cluster to the
   Internet. The easiest way to do this is to add a network rule that allows ingress traffic to port 30080 on at least
   one node
   (see
   [AWS Security Group rules](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html),
   [Google Cloud Platform Firewall rules](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vpc/using-firewalls)). Sourcegraph
   should then be accessible at `$EXTERNAL_ADDR_OF_YOUR_NODE:30080`. For production environments, we recommend using
   an [Internet Gateway](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) (or
   equivalent) and configuring a load balancer in Kubernetes.

You will now see the Sourcegraph setup page when you visit the address of your instance. If you made your instance
accessible on the public Internet, make sure you secure it before adding your private repositories.


### Install without RBAC

Sourcegraph Data Center communicates with the Kubernetes API for service discovery. It also has some janitor DaemonSets
which clean up temporary cache data. To do that we need to create RBAC resources. For details, see
Helm's
[Role-based Access Control documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/v2.8.2/docs/rbac.md).

If using RBAC is not an option, you can set `"site.rbac": "disabled"` in `conf.yaml` and run `helm init` instead of
`helm init --service-account tiller` to install Tiller.


### Install without Tiller

If installing Tiller is not an option, you can locally generate the Kubernetes configuration by running the following:

```
mkdir -p generated
helm template -f constants.yaml -f conf.yaml . --output-dir=generated
kubectl apply -R -f ./generated/sourcegraph/templates
```


## Update

Versions of Sourcegraph Data Center are released as tags in this Git repository. To update to a new version, fetch this
repository and check out the appropriate tag. To conveniently update to new versions of Data Center while additionally
tracking changes to your specific configuration (`conf.yaml`), we recommend the following procedure:

1. Fork this repository.
1. Clone your fork and configure the local clone to have an additional remote `upstream` set to `https://github.com/sourcegraph/datacenter`.
1. Copy `conf.default.yaml` to `conf.yaml` and keep your custom configuration in `conf.yaml`. Push changes to `master` in your fork.
1. On update:
   1. Run `git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/master`. There should never be conflicts, because you have
      not modified any of the original files.
   1. Run `git checkout $VERSION && git cherry-pick upstream/master...master` to cherry-pick your `conf.yaml` onto the
      tagged revision that contains the source files for the new version of Data Center.
   1. Install the `helm-diff` plugin (`helm plugin install https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff`). Then run `helm diff
      -f constants.yaml -f conf.yaml sourcegraph .` to display the update diff.
   1. Run `helm update -f constants.yaml -f conf.yaml sourcegraph .`.
   1. After updating, run `watch kubectl get pods -o wide` to verify the health of the cluster.

If you need to make changes to any of the existing files in this repository, please upstream your changes--pull requests
are very welcome!
