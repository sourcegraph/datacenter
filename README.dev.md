# Cutting a release

## Make the desired changes to this repository

### Updating docker image tags

- The vast majority of the time, [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com/docs/docker/) will open PRs in a timely manner.

- If you want to update them manually, you can update the Docker image versions in `*.Deployment.yaml` to match the tagged version that you are releasing.

  - You should look at our [DockerHub repositories](https://hub.docker.com/r/sourcegraph/) to see what the latest versions are.

  - Make sure to include the sha256 digest for each image, which [ensures that each image pull is immutable](https://renovatebot.com/docs/docker/#digest-pinning). Use `docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' $IMAGE` to get the digest.

## Open a PR

Wait for buildkite to pass and for your changes to be approved, then merge and check out `master`.

## Smoke test

Test what is currently checked in to master by [installing](docs/install.md) Sourcegraph on a fresh cluster.

### Provision a new cluster

1.  Create a cluster unique name that is identifiable to you (e.g `ggilmore-test`) in the [Sourcegraph Auxiliary GCP Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list?project=sourcegraph-server&organizationId=1006954638239).
    - You can create pool that has `3` nodes, each with `8` vCPUs and `30` GB memory (for a total of `24` vCPUs and `90` GB memory).
    - See this screenshot, but note that the UI could have changed: ![](https://imgur.com/RuCyGX2.png)
1.  Itâ€™ll take a few minutes for it to be provisioned. Youâ€™ll see a green checkmark when it is done.
1.  Click on the `connect` button next to your cluster, itâ€™ll give you a command to copy+paste in your terminal.
1.  Run the command in your terminal. Once it finishes, run `kubectl config current-context`. It should tell you that itâ€™s set up to talk to the cluster that you just created.

### Do smoke tests for `master` branch

1. Deploy the latest `master` to your new cluster by running through the quickstart steps in [docs/install.md](docs/install.md)
   - You'll need to create a GCP Storage Class named `sourcegraph` with the same `zone` that you created your cluster in (see ["Configure a storage class"](docs/configure.md#Configure-a-storage-class))
   - In order to give yourself permissions to create roles on the cluster, run: `kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole cluster-admin --user $YOUR_NAME@sourcegraph.com`
1. Use the instructions in [configure.md](docs/configure.md) to:
   1. Add a repository (e.g. [sourcegraph/sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph))
   1. Enable a language extension (e.g. [Go](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions/sourcegraph/lang-go)), and test that code intelligence is working on the above repository
   1. Do a couple test searches

### Check the upgrade path from the previous release to `master`

1. Tear down the cluster that you created above by deleting it through from the [Sourcegraph Auxiliary GCP Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list?project=sourcegraph-server&organizationId=1006954638239).
1. Checkout the commit that contains the configuration for the previous release (e.g. the commit has `2.11.x` images if you're currently trying to release `2.12.x`, etc.)
1. [Use the "Provision a new cluster" instructions above](#Provision-a-new-cluster) to create a new cluster.
1. Deploy the older commit to the new cluster, and do [the same smoke tests](#Do-smoke-tests-for-master-branch) with the older version.
1. Checkout the latest `master`, deploy the newer images to the same cluster (without tearing it down in between) by running `./kubectl-apply-all.sh`, and check to see [that the smoke test](#Do-smoke-tests-for-master-branch) passes after the upgrade process.

## Tag the release

The version numbers for [sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph) largely follow [sourcegraph/sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph)'s version numbers (i.e. `deploy-sourcegraph@v2.11.2` uses [sourcegraph/sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph)'s `v2.11.2` image tags).

### [sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph)'s branching strategy

#### Cutting a new minor version (e.g. `v2.12.0`)

- Make a branch named `2.12` that stems from the current `master` branch and push it. `2.12` will be used as the base for all `v2.12.x` images, and future changes to the `v2.12.x` series will be cherry-picked onto it and tagged from there.

  ```bash
  git checkout master
  git pull # make sure that you're up to date
  git checkout -b 2.12
  git push --set-upstream origin 2.12
  ```

- Follow [the tagging instructions below](#Create-a-git-tag-and-push-it-to-the-repository) to tag the `v2.12.0` release from the `2.12` branch.

#### Cutting a new patch version (e.g. `v2.12.1`)

- Cherry-pick the relevant commits from `master` that update the image tags to `v2.12.1` onto the `2.12` branch (which should have been created as mentioned above).

  ```bash
  git checkout 2.12
  git pull # make sure that you're up to date
  git cherry-pick commit0 commit1 ... # all relevant commits from the master branch
  git push
  ```

- Follow [the tagging instructions below](#Create-a-git-tag-and-push-it-to-the-repository) to tag the `v2.12.1` release from the `2.12` branch.

#### Only updating Kubernetes manifests/docs

_See [this commit](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph/commit/1d1846f67c01ad2a81741cf95ee867405d3de3ab) as an example of a change that would fall into this category._

- Cherry-pick the relevant commits from `master` that update the manifests/docs onto the `2.12` branch.

  ```bash
  git checkout 2.12
  git pull # make sure that you're up to date
  git cherry-pick commit0 commit1 ... # all relevant commits from the master branch
  git push
  ```

- We mark these kinds of releases with a version number that looks like `v2.12.0-2`. Note the `-2` suffix, which increments with each update like this that affects the `v2.12.0` series. Look at [the releases page](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph/releases), and pick the `suffix` that's next in the series.

- Follow [the tagging instructions below](#Create-a-git-tag-and-push-it-to-the-repository) to tag the `v2.12.0-2` release from the `2.12` branch.

### Create a git tag and push it to the repository

```bash
VERSION = vX.Y.Z

# If this is a release candidate: VERSION = `vX.Y.Z-pre${N}` (where `N` starts at 0 and increments as you test/cut new versions)

# ðŸš¨ Make sure that you have the commit that you want to tag as $VERSION checked out!

git tag $VERSION
git push origin $VERSION
```
