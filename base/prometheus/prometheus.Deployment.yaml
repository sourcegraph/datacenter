        # Prometheus is relied upon to monitor services for sending alerts to site admins when
        # something is wrong with Sourcegraph, thus its memory requests and limits are the same to
        # guarantee it has enough memory to perform its job reliably and prevent conflicts with
        # other pods on the same host node.
        #
        # Its average memory usage may be much lower than 3G if Sourcegraph itself does not have
        # much traffic, the 3G number chosen here is what works reliably on Sourcegraph.com with
        # lots of traffic.
