# lang-go

This folder contains the deployment manifests for the [Go language extension](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions/sourcegraph/go). 

## Installation instructions

### Setup TLS/SSL 

TLS/SSL is required for secure communication with the language server. Once you have completed ["Configure TLS/SSL"](../../../docs/configure.md#configure-tlsssl) in [docs/configure.md](../../../docs/configure.md#configure-tlsssl), change the `sourcegraph.example.com` domain in [configure/lang/go/lang-go.Ingress.yaml](lang-go.Ingress.yaml) to the real domain name that you are using for your Sourcegraph instance.

```yaml
spec:
    tls:
    - hosts:
    # ðŸš¨ TLS is required for secure communication with the language server. 
    # See the customization guide (../../../docs/configure.md) for information
    # about configuring TLS
    #
    # Make sure to replace 'sourcegraph.example.com' with the real domain that you are
    # using for your Sourcegraph instance.
      - sourcegraph.example.com
    secretName: sourcegraph-tls
    rules:
     - host: sourcegraph.example.com
```

### HTTP basic authentication

HTTP basic authentication is used to prevent unauthorized access to the language server. At a high level, you'll create a secret then put it in both [configure/lang/go/lang-go.Ingress.yaml](lang-go.Ingress.yaml) and in your Sourcegraph global settings so that logged-in users are authenticated when their browser makes requests to the Go language server.

_These instructions are derived from https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/auth/basic/_

1. Create an `.htpasswd` file in the current directory with one entry:

    ```console
    > htpasswd -c auth langserveruser 
    New password:
    Re-type new password:
    Adding password for user langserveruser
    ```

    **WARNING:** Do NOT commit the actual `auth` password file to your fork (unless your fork is
    private **and** you are okay with storing secrets in it).

1. Create a secret named `langserver-auth` from the `auth` file that you just created

    ```console
    > kubectl create secret generic langserver-auth --from-file=auth
    secret "basic-auth" created
    ```

   Update [create-new-cluster.sh](../../../create-new-cluster.sh) with the previous command.

   ```console
   echo kubectl create secret tls sourcegraph-tls --key $PATH_TO_KEY --cert $PATH_TO_CERT >> create-new-cluster.sh
   ```

1. Add the following fields to your Sourcegraph global settings (`$PASSWORD` is that password that you created above, and `$DOMAIN_NAME` is the domain name that you are using for your Sourcegraph instance):

    ```js
    "go.serverUrl": "wss://langserveruser:$PASSWORD@$DOMAIN_NAME/go",
    "go.sourcegraphUrl": "http://sourcegraph-frontend:30080",
    ```

### Apply the Go language server configuration to the cluster

1. Add the `kubectl` command that applies the Go language server configuration to [kubectl-apply-all.sh](../../../kubectl-apply-all.sh)

    ```console
    echo kubectl apply --prune -l deploy=lang-go -f configure/lang-go --recursive >> kubectl-apply-all.sh
    ```

1. Apply your changes to the cluster

    ```console
    ./kubectl-apply-all.sh
    ```
